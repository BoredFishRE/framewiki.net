# Input Modules

Input Modules are custom modules that slot into the top of the [Framework Laptop 16](https://framewiki.net/framework-laptop-16) that enable users to choose how they want their laptop configured, for example with or without a numpad.

On the Framework Laptop 16, there are 8 connectors to slot your Input Modules into, 5 of which are USB capable (3 on the left side and 2 on the right side), 3 of which are i2c only (middle three) which can only be used with the trackpad. Input Modules are based on QMK keyboard software which runs on the Raspberry Pi RP2040 microcontroller inside the Input Module.

# Third-Party Input Modules

Framework published electrical and mechanical information on their [GitHub repository](https://github.com/FrameworkComputer/InputModules) to allow third parties to design and manufacture their own Input Modules.

As of now (September 2023), a few people are working on building their own Input Modules, but none are available for sale. One example:

- RGB LED Matrix Input Module by Joe Schroedl. Available on [GitHub](https://github.com/corndog2000/RGB-LED-Matrix-Input-Module)
