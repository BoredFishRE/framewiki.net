# Framework Laptop 13

Framework Laptop 13 is [Framework](/framework-computer-inc)'s first product. Initially branded simply as Framework Laptop, the company rebranded the product as Framework Laptop 13 in 2023 to distinguish it from the newly-announced [Framework Laptop 16](/framework-laptop-16). 

The initial version featured 11th Gen Intel Core CPUs, but it has since been updated with 12th and 13th Gen Intel CPUS, as well as AMD 7040 series offerings. 

## DIY Edition
Framework Laptop 13 is available in pre-built and DIY configurations. Though the initial intent was for consumers to assemble the entire laptop themselves, DIY edition laptops come mostly pre-assembled for legal and practical reasons. Shipping components individually would require more packing material and a physically larger package, which would increase shipping costs. It would also change the package's import designation, which would add additional tariffs and duties.

The first batches of DIY edition laptops had consumers install their own RAM, SSD, Wifi and Expansion cards. After receiving feedback that the WiFi module was difficult to install, Framework began installing it at the factory.

Beginning with 13th Gen Intel Core and AMD 7040 Series, DIY edition Framework Laptop 13s began shipping without the input cover and bezel installed in order to add more customization options and optimize the number of SKUs required. [[citation needed]](/framewiki:citation-needed)

## Generations
### 11th Gen Intel Core
Batch 1 of 11th Gen Intel Core began shipping in August 2021. In October 2021, Framework switched the audio codec from Realtek ALC295 to the Tempo 92HD95B due to chip shortages. [[4]](https://frame.work/blog/solving-for-silicon-shortages)

### 12th Gen Intel Core
Batch 1 of 12th Gen Intel Core began shipping in July 2022. It featured an improved CNC alluminum top cover. It also included electrical changes that meant the Real Time Clock battery was no longer required for the laptop to function. 

YouTuber Linus Sebastian, of Linus Tech Tips, incorrectly claimed that 12th Gen also shipped with 4kg hinges. [[5]](https://youtube.com/watch?v=SYc922ntnKM) In fact, it shipped with the same 3.3kg hinges as 11th gen, but 4kg hinges were made available as an optional component.

### 13th Gen Intel Core
Batch 1 of 13th Gen Intel Core began shipping in May 2023. It was announced at the same time as AMD 7040 series. It features a new matte display, compared to previous generations' glossy displays, and improved 3.5kg hinges. 13th gen does not come with the RTC battery pre-populated, but an ML1220 battery holder can be populated by the consumer for standalone mainboard use. It also includes louder 80 dB speakers and a WiFi card bracket which holds the antenna connectors in place while the user handles the card.

Devices configured with a Core i7 CPU also include a higher-capacity 61 watt hour battery.

### AMD 7040 Series
Batch one of AMD 7040 series began mass production in Sep 2023. It was announced at the same time as 13th Gen Intel Core. It features the same matte display, improved hinges and WiFi card bracket as 13th Gen Intel Core. AMD 7040 series changed from an ML1220 battery holder to a two-pin RTC battery connector, which is still unpopulated by default. 

Devices configured with a Ryzen 7 CPU also include the higher-capacity 61 watt hour battery.
